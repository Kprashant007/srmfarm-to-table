# srmfarm-to-table
SRM Farm-to-Table Project is an initiative to establish an online platform for customers to purchase fresh and locally grown vegetables. The project will leverage the resources and expertise of a college to produce high-quality vegetables using sustainable farming practices. The e-commerce platform will enable customers to conveniently access the farm's produce, providing a healthy and eco-friendly alternative to store-bought vegetables. The project aims to promote sustainable agriculture and healthy eating habits, while also creating an additional source of revenue for the college.
The website will feature an easy-to-use interface where customers can browse and select from a wide variety of vegetables. The website will also provide detailed information about the farming practices used to grow the vegetables, as well as the origin and nutritional value of each vegetable. The website will be optimized for mobile devices, making it convenient for customers to place orders on-the-go.
The project will also benefit the farmers by providing them with a new source of income and creating opportunities for employment as well as college. 
Overall, the Online Farm Website Project is an innovative solution that addresses the challenges of limited access to fresh and locally grown vegetables. By promoting sustainable agriculture and healthy eating habits, the project contributes to the well-being of both the consumers and the environment.
